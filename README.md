# NdT3 Contact Form Back-end

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/15ec936f1cb44a02a7934e05e35c69dd)](https://www.codacy.com/app/NdT3Development/NdT3-contact-form-backend?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=NdT3Development/NdT3-contact-form-backend&utm_campaign=badger)

This is the back-end for the contact form on [my website](https://ndt3.ml).
My website is currently hosted on GitHub Pages, which allows for static site hosting. Anything that required back-end (in this case, the contact form) had to have the back-end hosted separately.

This repository is used by me to easily transfer file changes to my server so there may be frequent commits. **These may break the entire application at any time.**

Code for the reCaptcha part of the back-end used was from [this tutorial](https://codeforgeek.com/2016/03/google-recaptcha-node-js-tutorial/)
