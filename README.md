# NdT3 Contact Form Back-end

*This is no longer used*

This is the back-end for the contact form on [my website](https://ndt3.me).
My website is currently hosted on GitHub Pages, which allows for static site hosting. Anything that required back-end (in this case, the contact form) had to have the back-end hosted separately.

### Please note:
**This is provided here only for people who want to see how this was done. NO SUPPORT WILL BE GIVEN IF YOU ATTEMPT TO SELF-HOST THIS**

This repository is used by me to easily transfer file changes to my server so there may be frequent commits. **These may break the entire application at any time.**

Code for the reCaptcha part of the back-end used was from [this tutorial](https://codeforgeek.com/2016/03/google-recaptcha-node-js-tutorial/)
